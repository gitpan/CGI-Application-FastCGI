NAME
    CGI::Application::FastCGI - for using CGI::Application under FastCGI

SYNOPSIS
      # In "WebApp.pm"...
      package WebApp;
      use base qw(CGI::Application::FastCGI);
      sub setup {
        ...
      }
      1;

      # In "webapp.fcgi"...
      use WebApp;
      my $webapp = WebApp->new;
      $webapp->run;

DESCRIPTION
    Inherit this module instead of CGI::Application if you want to run your
    cgi programs based on CGI::Application under FastCGI.

NOTES
    Note that cgiapp_init() will be called only once under lifecycle of
    FastCGI. setup() will also only be called once. (you should not be doing
    magical things in 'setup'.) So if you want to do something for every
    REQUESTS, you should write the logic in cgiapp_prerun().

SEE ALSO
    CGI::Application, FCGI
